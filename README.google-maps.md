# Vue Users

This document describes how to configure and securely use a **Google Maps API key** for the [Vue Users](./README.md) application in both development and production environments.

> For the main project overview and instructions, see the [main README](./README.md).

### Create a Google Maps API Key

To use Google Maps both in development and production, you need to create and configure an API key from Google Cloud.

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create or select a project.
3. Enable the **Maps JavaScript API**.
4. Create a new **API key**.
5. Restrict the key (Recommended):
   - **API restriction**: `Maps JavaScript API`
   - **Web restriction**:
     - `http://localhost:8080/*` (for development)
     - `https://beatrizsmerino.github.io/` (for production)

### Development Setup (env)

To use the API key in local development, assign it to the `VUE_APP_TOKEN_GOOGLE_MAPS` environment variable.

1. If you donâ€™t have a `.env.local` file yet, generate it with the `npm run env:create` command.
2. Open `.env.local` file and set your API key to `VUE_APP_TOKEN_GOOGLE_MAPS` variable.
3. Restart the development server to apply changes with the `npm run serve` command.

> The `.env.local` file is generated from a `.env.local.sample` template to provide a consistent starting point for environment variables across the team. Only `.env.local` is used at runtime and should contain your actual sensitive values, this file is gitignored to avoid exposing secrets.  
> The variable name of `VUE_APP_TOKEN_GOOGLE_MAPS` starts with `VUE_APP_` because Vue CLI only exposes environment variables with that prefix to your application code during the build process. Without it, the variable would not be available in your components.

### Production Setup (GitHub Actions, GitHub Pages)

To use the API key in production builds (GitHub Pages), store `VUE_APP_TOKEN_GOOGLE_MAPS` securely as a GitHub Actions secret.

1. Go in your GitHub repository to [**Settings** â†’ **Secrets** â†’ **Actions**](https://github.com/beatrizsmerino/vue-users/settings/secrets/actions)
2. Click **"New repository secret"**, set the name as `VUE_APP_TOKEN_GOOGLE_MAPS` and add your API key as the value.
3. To apply changes use the `npm run deploy` command.

> During the deployment process (`npm run deploy`), the `gh-pages-deploy.mjs` script runs the `npm run build` command, that loads the API key from `.env.local` in local environments. However, this file does not exist in the GitHub Actions environment, so the key must be provided as a GitHub Actions secret. The workflow passes the secret as an environment variable named `VUE_APP_TOKEN_GOOGLE_MAPS`, so that Vue can access the key and inject it into the compiled codeâ€”just like in local development.  
> This ensures that the Vue build has access to the API key without exposing it in the codebase, keeping the production build consistent with local development.
